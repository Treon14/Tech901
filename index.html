            <p>Hello, my name is Tyrez and I am taking this course for a couple of diffrent reasons.The first being a new challenge, and the hurdle of trying to accomplish somthing I did not see as possible a year ago.
                The second being I would really like to see what I can build.If I had any super powers it would probably be the ability to stare and nod at someone while being completely confused.Not the best power but it has helped me over the years.
                I hope it serves me well in this course.Best case scenerio I won't need it. <p>
